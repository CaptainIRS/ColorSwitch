# Color Switch
Delta Web Dev Task - 2

Play the game online at : https://captainirs.github.io/ColorSwitch

## Task Description
### The Last Draw
Bharath has found his speed tester, and has assigned him his work. Bharath now sits free, with plenty of time in his hands. So he intends to play a game to pass his time. Unbeknownst to even his close friends Bharath (aka Mr. Gray) actually loves colors. Help him paint his playroom similar to this so he remains engaged while his junior completes the task.

### Normal mode
* Create a game where the user presses a button or taps on the screen to make a ball jump.
* Generate random circular obstacles with at least two colours on each obstacle.
* Touching an obstacle of different colour results in a game over.
* Calculate score based on distance travelled.
* Add sound effects.
* Store high score in local storage.

Mr. Gray likes this game and shows it to his friend, Shake. Shake wants to shake things up a bit and suggests more features for the game.

### Hacker mode
* Update the high scores in real time.
* Have more than two colours and add a mechanism to switch the colour of the ball.
* Make buttons to pause and resume the game at any point.
* Increase game difficulty by increasing the speed of rotation and direction of movement of obstacles.

Bharath and Shake really like the game, but unfortunately they can't play it together.

### Hacker mode+++
* Generate different types of obstacles.
* Include power-ups like a multi-colour ball which can pass through obstacles of any colour, slower rotation modes etc. Use sprites for power-ups.
* Have a split screen multiplayer mode so that Bharath and Shake can challenge each other.

### Submission
* Submission will be to your mentors and also on the site. You can ask them any questions you may have.
* Normal mode is necessary, hacker mode is highly recommended.
Submission Deadline - 14th May, Thursday.

### Required Skills
You’ll need to learn a fair bit of JavaScript for this task, especially using the canvas tag and the Canvas JavsScript API.

Refer to the Beginner’s guide that was posted for more resources.

#### Refer Canvas API

### Limitations
You are not allowed to use any frameworks, like Phaser.io for example. The code must be in Vanilla JS only. You also don’t require a backend, and you shouldn’t need to make one.
